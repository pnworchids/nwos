    %p Membership is open to anyone, many of our members are brand new to orchid growing as a hobby and find a lot to learn at each new meeting. Some of our members join with years of orchid care under their belt and find a community in which they can give back and help to educate the next generation of orchid enthusiasts. Whether you just bought your first phalaenopsis, or you already have a greenhouse filled with your favorite species and hybrids there are many benefits to joining our society.
